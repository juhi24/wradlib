This recipe section provides a collection of code snippets for exemplary $\omega radlib$ applications. Compared to the other notebooks, the level of documentation is a bit lower. For each recipe, we provide a short summary and a link to the example code.

Please feel to send us your recipes so we can include them on this page. Please open an issue at the [wradlib_github issue tracker](https://github.com/wradlib/wradlib) containing:

- *optional*: name and affiliation

- a suggested title of the recipe

- a short description of the recipe (max. 100 words)

- the recipe code (please add comments within the code!)

- *optional*: the data needed to run the code (or a hyperlink to the data)

- *optional*: some test output of the recipe (e.g. an image file)
